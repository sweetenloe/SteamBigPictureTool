# SteamBigPictureTool

A simple Windows tool that converts videos to Steam-compatible WebM intros and safely installs them for Steam Big Picture Mode.

This tool lets you convert any video into a Steam-compatible WebM intro, automatically set up the required Steam folders, and drop the finished file in the right place for Big Picture Mode. It also checks for ffmpeg and installs it if needed, so you don’t have to mess with command-line tools or Steam’s config directories manually.

Now no need to just buy Steam's videos for Big Picture Mode, you can upload your own!
